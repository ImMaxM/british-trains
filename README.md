# 🇬🇧 British Trains

> A simple British train enhancement script for FiveM

## Features

- 🚀 Blazingly fast
- 🚂 Realistic train speeds
- 🤖 Automatic station detection
- 📊 Resource efficient

## Installation

> ⚙️ Optional ~ Download and install [**Project London Remastered**](https://www.gta5-mods.com/misc/project-london-remastered-wip-oiv-fivem-beta) for the british train model

1. Download the [**latest release**](https://github.com) from GitHub
2. Upload to FiveM resources folder
3. Add `start trains` to your server.cfg

## Usage

Trains will spawn when a player joins, this resource is only intended to be used with one player as the trains will not sync with multiple players in the server.

> 💡 I have not been able to get this to sync with multiple players as this was just made for testing purposes, if you know how to do this please let me know or open a PR.
